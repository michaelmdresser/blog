# Running and growing an education-oriented college club

While in college, I became a managing member of the school's Cybersecurity Club [1]
because I loved the subject and enjoyed running some of our more educational meetings.

[1] When I first joined, it was called the Ethical Hacking club, a name which I am
still very fond of. I believe changing it improved our funding opportunities.
