        <h1>Koka's effects: modify the log level of an HTTP handler at runtime</h1>

        <p>Date: 2022-04-24</p>

<p>Sometimes, when I'm debugging an HTTP handler, I wish I could set the log level to DEBUG for just one call to the handler.</p>
<p>This would solve some problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>The application doesn't have to be restarted to change the log level. Changing arguments and restarting can be challenging in production environments or when the software is deployed in a user-controlled environment.</li>
<li>I won't be flooded with DEBUG-level logs from parts of the application I probably don't care about</li>
</ol>
<p>With the <a href="https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/index.html">Koka</a> language's effects, this seems possible. I'm new to the language and certainly won't be doing all of its merits justice, but let's see what changing the log level for a call stack/context (like an HTTP handler) at runtime might look like!</p>
<h1 id="the-code">The code</h1>
<p>First, we'll define our effect, <code>log</code>, which takes a level and a string and does… something.</p>
<pre id="log" class="koka"><code>effect fun log( level : int, msg : string ) : ()
</code></pre>
<p>Let's write some mock business logic for our "HTTP handler": some calls to <code>log</code>. This highlights Koka's effect system. The logic calls an effect, <code>log</code>, whose handler hasn't been defined yet — all it knows is the effect's type signature.</p>
<pre id="http-handler-logic" class="koka"><code>fun http-handler-logic( foo : string , bar : string )
  log(2, &quot;FOO:&quot; ++ foo)
  log(3, &quot;BAR:&quot; ++ bar)
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we'll create a function that sets up an effect handler for <code>log</code>: <code>log-leveled</code>, which has different behavior depending on the log level. If the log level is within the target level's range, print the message. Otherwise, do nothing.</p>
<pre id="log-leveled" class="koka"><code>fun level-to-string( level : int ) : string
  match level
    0 -&gt; &quot;ERROR&quot;
    1 -&gt; &quot;WARNING&quot;
    2 -&gt; &quot;INFO&quot;
    3 -&gt; &quot;DEBUG&quot;
    _ -&gt; &quot;UNKNOWN LEVEL&quot;

fun log-leveled( target-level : int, action )
  with fun log( level, msg ) {
    if level &lt;= target-level then
      println(level-to-string(level) ++ &quot;:&quot; ++ msg)
  }

  action()
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, our "HTTP handler." We'll set up the handler for <code>log</code> in this context by using <code>log-leveled</code>: depending on the value of <code>verbose</code>, calls to <code>log</code> will be set up to log at either the DEBUG level or the INFO level. A simple block of code, yet a fundamental difference from the global logger situation I'm so used to!</p>
<pre id="http-handler" class="koka"><code>fun http-handler( verbose : bool )
  var log-level := 2
  if verbose then {
    log-level := 3
  }
  with log-leveled(log-level)

  return http-handler-logic(&quot;testfoo&quot;, &quot;testbar&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>All we need is a <code>main()</code> to tie it all together. Please forgive the <code>&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;</code> blocks, they're just tags to pull the earlier code in.</p>
<pre id="main" class="koka" data-noweb="yes" data-results="output"><code>&lt;&lt;log&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;http-handler-logic&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;log-leveled&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;http-handler&gt;&gt;

fun main()
  println(&quot;++Simulating a handler call with verbose=false&quot;)
  http-handler(False)
  println(&quot;++Done&quot;)

  println(&quot;&quot;)

  println(&quot;++Simulating a handler call with verbose=true&quot;)
  http-handler(True)
  println(&quot;++Done&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>After <code>koka -e logtest.kk</code>:</p>
<pre class="example"><code>++Simulating a handler call with verbose=false
INFO:FOO:testfoo
++Done

++Simulating a handler call with verbose=true
INFO:FOO:testfoo
DEBUG:BAR:testbar
++Done
</code></pre>
<p>Just like that, we've changed the log level for a call stack, dynamically, at run time!</p>
<h1 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h1>
<p>I'm fairly certain this technique can be generalized to a proper library for logging if given the proper care. Just think: using the effect system at startup time to set the log destination (<code>stdout</code>, <code>stderr</code>, a file) and default level, then using flags like our <code>verbose</code> to make an update for a given call! Awesome stuff.</p>
<p>I'm uncertain what the performance overheads might be. An idea for another day, perhaps.</p>
<h2 id="on-koka">On Koka</h2>
<p>Koka is an interesting language. I'm new to the concept of effects, so the documentation is slow reading and the code often takes a few tries to wrap my head around. This mini-project happened because I was trying to explain what effects would actually be useful for to someone; I'm not familiar with any canonical use cases for effects, so I came up with this contrived one.</p>
<p>The documentation could do with some improvement. For example, the "Basics" section skips past fundamental language constructs (like <code>if</code>) and focuses instead on some of Koka's more unique features. It'd help to start with more "basics" first.</p>
